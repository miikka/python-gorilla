A Python implementation of the [Gorilla algorithm] for compressing floating point data.

## Playground

Under `webapp`, there's a simple web app that allows you to step through the encoding process.

> [!WARNING]
> The web app was generated using OpenAI's Codex tool and the code quality is YOLO.
> The actual algorithm was handcrafted though.
